## Welcome
We like to provide the best experience at this React Bootcamp to ensure you have the necessary skills.

With that said, we prepared a Challenge using an online IDE called [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/ide). It's split up into five mini challenges as below.

### Challenges
- [React](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-challenge-1-template-sgyjm?file=/README.md) with **Basic skills**
- [React](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-challenge-2-8wdkb?file=/src/README.md) with **Loops**
- [React](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-challenge-3-challenge-xr5cp?file=/README.md) with **Filtering**
- [React](https://codesandbox.io/s/pokemon-name-challenge-template-bj51c?file=/README.md) with **Validations**
- [React](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-challenge-5-ybvrq?file=/README.md) with **Testing**

### How to operate
1. [Join](https://codesandbox.io/signin) CodeSandbox or **sign in** with your credentials.
2. **Go to the link** of one task.
3. Click on the top-right button **Fork**, that would create a copy of the task in your account.
4. You can **copy the link** at your browser for later sharing with us
5. **Resolve** the task
6. There are three main sections, file structure on the left, the editor in the middle and the preview on the right.
7. All changes made at the editor would be reflected at the preview.

#### Considerations regarding CodeSandbox
- It supports auto-save but can always press CTRL+S
- In case the preview fails, just make sure your work is saved and refresh the window
- If you get issues using `.jsx` extension, switch them over to be `.js`

### How to send your work
Take into consideration that not all tasks are directly related. You might resolve what you can on each challenge and send us the result through [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAxUnF0YiWMMrNVlppuCbKnpAaBGN6mu4nxZAuzFDvrB4mMg/viewform).  Use the form once you have given your best effort for all the challenges.

The evaluation team would decide based on the effort you put at every challenge.

Good luck and vibes ðŸ˜„ !!
