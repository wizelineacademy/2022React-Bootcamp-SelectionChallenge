# React-Bootcamp-Challenge
Welcome
We like to provide the best experience at this React Bootcamp to ensure you have the necessary skills.

With that said, we prepared a Challenge using an online IDE called CodeSandbox. It's split up into five mini challenges as below.

Challenges
React with Basic skills
React with Loops
React with Filtering
React with Validations
React with Testing
How to operate
Join CodeSandbox or sign in with your credentials.
Go to the link of one task.
Click on the top-right button Fork, that would create a copy of the task in your account.
You can copy the link at your browser for later sharing with us
Resolve the task
There are three main sections, file structure on the left, the editor in the middle and the preview on the right.
All changes made at the editor would be reflected at the preview.
Considerations regarding CodeSandbox
It supports auto-save but can always press CTRL+S
In case the preview fails, just make sure your work is saved and refresh the window
If you get issues using .jsx extension, switch them over to be .js
How to send your work
Take into consideration that not all tasks are directly related. You might resolve whatever you can and send us the result. The evaluation team would decide based on the effort you put at every challenge.

Please send us an email to apac-react-bootcamp@wizeline.com with the following elements:
